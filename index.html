    Representing a three-dimensional space in two dimensions necessarily involves a reconfiguration.
    Any topographic map has <br> to respects pre-established conventions, it's a device for knowledge that returns the imprint of the society that created it.
    The one who produces the map has the possibility to establish a hierarchy among the informations, deciding what to focus on and what to leave out.
    Geolocation technologies such as google maps allow you to always place yourself at the center of your own cosmos, giving back the illusion that space develops around us.
    This vision of the world creates "gaps", spaces that result invisible if the fruition of places only passes through technologies such as virtual maps.

    GAP topography focuses on inaccessible and disconnected places, giving them visibility. <br>
    Through the use of a 360 camera and a pen plotter, the spaces are reproduced through an unconventional map,
    in order to represent, through the distortion of the image, the difficulty in the fruition of that space itself.
